# calibrate_camera

Hi!</br>
This is a little program to run camera calibration!</br>
It can compute the intrinsic matrix of the camera and the position of every picture which is taken, and also the distortion coefficients.</br>
It is realized using opencv, in C++ language, under the IDE of visual studio 2015.</br>
main.cpp is in the CalibCamera directory. The pictures used to calibrate is in chess_pic_data directory. </br>
And the result output is in result_dir directory, including matrix file and undistorted images.</br>
I hope this will help you get a better understanding on camera calibration!</br>
