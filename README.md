# calibrate_camera

Hi!
This is a little program to run camera calibration!
It can compute the intrinsic matrix of the camera and the position of every picture which is taken, and also the distortion coefficients.
It is realized using opencv, in C++ language, under the IDE of visual studio 2015.
main.cpp is in the CalibCamera directory. The pictures used to calibrate is in chess_pic_data directory. 
And the result output is in result_dir directory, including matrix file and undistorted images.
I hope this will help you get a better understanding on camera calibration!
